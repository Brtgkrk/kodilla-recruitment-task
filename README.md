It features different sections, including a header with a navigation menu, a main section showcasing the product and its features, and a footer with additional links.

The use of CSS methodologies like BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) and Flexbox has been incorporated for better organization and layout.
The website has been tested to ensure proper rendering and functionality across different devices and browsers.
